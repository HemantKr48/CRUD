REST API -JSON  (you should respect http methods  and server and client should be independent)

GET /users  - List all users  (render an html page (SSR), when it knows that surely a browser is the client)
GET /api/users - sends the data as json, so that a mobile app or react can handle that at the client side

GET api/users/2  -Get the user with ID 2
GET /api/users/:id


POST api/users  -create new user

PATCH api/users/1  - Edit the user with ID 1

DELETE api/users/1 -Delete the user with ID 1
